/**
 * API key permissions required by ImmichFrame, with metadata about their
 * impact. This is the single source of truth used by:
 *
 * - [com.dav3.immichframe.data.remote.ImmichRepositoryImpl.checkPermissions]
 *   to probe each endpoint and determine what works
 * - [com.dav3.immichframe.ui.setup.SetupViewModel] to decide whether setup
 *   can proceed (blocking) or should degrade gracefully (optional)
 * - [com.dav3.immichframe.ui.settings.SettingsScreen] to render the
 *   permission status list and lock gated settings
 *
 * When adding a new feature that requires a new Immich permission, add an
 * entry here and the rest of the pipeline picks it up automatically.
 *
 * @property scope The Immich permission string (e.g. "album.read")
 * @property featureName Short description of what this enables (user-facing)
 * @property blocking If true, the app is unusable without this permission
 *   and setup must be blocked. If false, the feature is disabled but the
 *   user can proceed in a degraded mode.
 * @property gatedSettingKey The DataStore key of the setting that should be
 *   forced off when this permission is missing, or null if no setting is
 *   gated (blocking permissions don't gate a setting — they block the app).
