## User Flows

### F1: First-Run Setup

1. App launches with no stored credentials.
2. **Step 1 — Domain Validation:**
   - Setup screen prompts for Immich Server URL (protocol dropdown + domain field).
   - User taps "Validate Server".
   - App calls `GET /server/version` + `GET /server/features` (no auth required)
     to detect the Immich version and available auth methods.
   - On failure: show error message (wrong URL, unreachable). Stay on domain step.
   - On success: display detected version (e.g. "Immich v1.135.0"), advance to auth step.
3. **Step 2 — Authentication (manual paste is default):**
   - **Enter Manually** (default): User pastes an existing API key, then taps
     "Test Connection" (the legacy flow). Below the key field, a helper button
     offers auto-generation for users who don't have a key yet.
   - **Generate Key** (helper button): Email + password fields. App calls
     `POST /auth/login` → obtains a JWT → `POST /api-keys` to create a scoped
     key with 5 permissions → `POST /auth/logout` to invalidate the session.
     Password is used once and never persisted; the login session is closed
     immediately after key creation so the device does not appear in the
     server's "Authorized Devices" list. The API key is independent of the
     session and remains valid.
     A note reminds the user to log in with the account meant for this photo
     frame (not necessarily their personal account).
     A `?` icon opens a dialog explaining what an API key is, why the app
     generates one, and that the password is discarded immediately.
   - **OAuth** (shown only if server has OAuth enabled): User taps "Sign in with
     OAuth" → browser opens via Custom Tabs (PKCE flow) → callback deep-link
     returns to the app → JWT obtained → key created → session logged out.
4. App validates the key by calling `GET /users/me`.
5. **Permission verification**: App probes all 4 required endpoints in
   dependency order (user → albums → search → thumbnail) to verify
   the key has the necessary scopes. Results are stored as `permission_status`
   in DataStore.
   - If a **blocking** permission is missing (`user.read`, `album.read`,
     `asset.read`, `asset.view`), setup is blocked with an error showing
     which permissions are missing and a shortcut to generate a properly-
     scoped key.
6. Credentials persisted: API key to encrypted on-device storage, server version
   + key-scope flag + permission status to DataStore.
7. On success, proceed to **Settings** so the user can configure the frame
   (interval, clock, night mode, display fit, etc.) before selecting albums.
   All settings have sensible defaults, so the user can simply press back to
   skip. From Settings, back goes to **Album Selection** (first-run path).

### F2: Album Selection

1. App calls `GET /albums` to fetch the user's album list.
2. Display albums as a scrollable grid with:
   - Album thumbnail (first asset preview)
   - Album name
   - Asset count
3. User taps one or more albums (multi-select).
4. User taps "Start Slideshow".
5. Selected album IDs persisted to DataStore.
6. Slideshow begins.

When this screen was opened from **Settings → Change Album Selection**, its
top bar shows **Back to Settings** rather than the Settings gear. Choosing it
returns without saving the temporary selection. **Start Slideshow** is the only
action that saves the selected albums.

**Empty states:**
- **Server reachable but zero albums**: shows a "No albums available"
  message with a Retry button (the user may need to create an album in
  Immich first).
- **Server unreachable**: shows the error detail with a Retry button.
  Previously selected albums (if any) are preserved in DataStore so the
  user can retry without re-selecting.

### F3: Slideshow Playback

1. App loads assets for selected album(s). **Cache-first**: if assets are
   already cached locally (Room database), they're displayed immediately
   — including the preview image bytes themselves, which are read from disk
   via `file://` URIs. This means the slideshow works fully **offline**:
   once assets are cached, no server contact is needed to display them.
   On a cold start (empty cache), the app fetches asset metadata from the
   server via `POST /search/metadata`. If **Auto Sync** is enabled, a
   background WorkManager job downloads new/updated assets and reconciles
   deletions. The running slideshow observes the local cache, so a completed
   sync updates its photo count and adds/removes media without requiring a
   screen transition or app restart.
   While that cache snapshot is loading, the controls omit the count rather
   than briefly showing a zero-photo placeholder.
   If the image currently on screen was deleted, it remains visible until the
   normal next-photo transition; its local preview is deleted immediately
   after that transition. Non-visible deleted images are removed at sync time.
2. If multiple albums selected, asset lists are merged.
3. If **Shuffle** is enabled (default on), the merged list is randomized.
4. **Skip Videos** is permanently enabled. Video assets are never downloaded
   or displayed, and the setting cannot be disabled.
5. **Animated GIFs** use the static Immich preview; originals are not fetched.
6. Slideshow displays each image fullscreen for the configured interval (default 30s).
7. Transition between images is a crossfade (default 1s).
8. Next image is pre-fetched and cached so transitions are instant.
9. When the last image is reached, the slideshow loops back to the first.
10. Screen stays on (wake lock) while slideshow is active (toggleable).
11. When the **device screen turns off** (locked / power button), the slideshow
    pauses entirely: the auto-advance timer stops, and any playing video is
    paused (no audio plays while the screen is off). Playback resumes
    automatically when the screen turns back on.
12. A progress bar at the bottom shows time remaining for the current image.
13. **Photo Animations**: When enabled, each photo gets a subtle Ken Burns
    style animation (zoom/pan). The animation is chosen randomly from the
    set of individually-enabled animation types. Available types: Zoom In,
    Zoom Out, Pan Left, Pan Right, Pan Up, Pan Down, Random. Random picks
    from the other enabled types and requires at least one other type enabled.
14. If an image fails to decode or does not complete loading within 20 seconds,
    the app logs the asset ID and automatically skips to the next photo. A
    late callback from an older transition cannot skip the newly visible photo.

**Offline / album lifecycle:**
- **Server unreachable**: the slideshow continues displaying cached media
  from disk. No error is shown as long as the cache has content. The
  background sync worker silently skips (transient errors are non-fatal;
  existing cache is preserved).
- **Album deleted on server**: when the sync worker detects a 404 for a
  selected album, it purges that album's cache. If **all** selected albums
  are gone, the selection is cleared and the app navigates back to album
  selection so the user can pick again. If only some albums are gone, the
  remaining albums keep displaying.
- **Transient empty metadata response**: the reconcile step guards against
   wiping the cache when the server returns an empty asset list (which could
   indicate a transient search-service issue). Cache is only pruned when the
   remote list is non-empty, or when Immich's album metadata independently
   confirms that the selected album contains zero assets. If all selected
   albums are confirmed empty, the active photo remains as a fallback and the
   controls show **"0 photos · displaying the last photo"** until new media
   is synchronized.

### F4: In-Slideshow Controls

Tap the screen to reveal controls:
- Previous / Next arrows
- Pause / Play
- Photo count (current position / total)
- Update status icon (checking / downloading / ready)
- Launcher switch (apps icon, when Launcher Mode is active)
- Settings (gear icon)

Controls auto-hide after 5 seconds of no interaction.

### F4b: Clock Overlay

When **Show Clock** is enabled, a clock is displayed on top of the slideshow.

- **Position**: Long-press and drag the clock to reposition it anywhere on screen.
  Position is stored as normalized coordinates (0.0–1.0) and persists across launches.
- **Size**: Configurable via slider (24–96 sp).
- **Snap to Grid**: When enabled (default on), the clock snaps to a grid based on
  its font size when released after dragging.
- **Clock drift**: When photo animations are enabled, the clock also drifts slightly
  (±4 px horizontal over 30s, ±3 px vertical over 45s) to prevent OLED burn-in.

### F5: Subsequent Launch (Auto-Resume)

1. App checks for stored credentials and selected album IDs.
2. If both exist, skip setup and album selection.
3. Go directly to slideshow (fetch album assets, start playing).
4. If credentials are invalid (API returns 401), fall back to setup screen.

### F5b: Start on Boot

When **Start on Boot** is enabled, the app launches automatically when the device
boots. On Android 10+ (API 29+), the OS blocks starting an Activity from a
background `BroadcastReceiver` (Background Activity Launch restriction) unless
the app holds the `SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW` ("Display over other apps") permission.
The app prompts the user to grant this permission when the feature is toggled on,
and shows a "Grant Display Over Other Apps" button in Settings until it is
granted. On certain OEMs (Xiaomi, Oppo, Vivo, Huawei, Honor, etc.) that further
restrict autostart, the app detects the manufacturer and prompts the user to
grant the autostart permission, deep-linking to the correct system settings
screen.

The app self-tests whether the BootReceiver actually fired after a reboot by
tracking a `bootVerified` flag. Toggling **Start on Boot** resets this flag to
false. After each reboot, the BootReceiver sets it to true (if it received the
broadcast). In Settings, the "Open Autostart Settings" button is shown only when
the feature is on, the device is a restricted OEM, and the flag is false — i.e.,
the receiver hasn't proven itself yet. Once verified by a successful reboot, the
button disappears and a normal description is shown.

### F5c: Launcher Mode (Home Replacement)

When **Launcher Mode** is enabled, the app registers itself as a Home launcher
by enabling an `activity-alias` in the manifest via
`PackageManager.setComponentEnabledSetting()`. The system always launches the
default Home app on boot and on Home-button press — no BOOT_COMPLETED broadcast,
no autostart permission, and no Background Activity Launch restriction applies.
This is the **most reliable autostart method**, especially on Chinese OEM ROMs
(OPPO/Realme/Xiaomi/etc.) that silently block boot broadcasts to non-whitelisted
apps, and works around the known Android 15/16 BOOT_COMPLETED delivery bug.

When Launcher Mode is on, the app shows an **"Open Launcher Settings"** button in
Settings that opens the system Home settings page
(`ACTION_HOME_SETTINGS`), allowing the user to switch to a different launcher
or re-select this app. The same button is available in the slideshow hover UI
(top bar, apps icon) when launcher mode is active, so the user can switch
launchers without navigating to settings.

If the app loses its default-launcher status while Launcher Mode is enabled
(e.g., the user selected another launcher), a dialog appears on resume
prompting the user to re-select Immich Photo Display as the default Home.
Toggling Launcher Mode off disables the alias and reverts to normal
behaviour.

### F5d: Self-Update via GitHub Releases

On startup (if **Auto-Update** is enabled and the app was NOT installed from the
Play Store), the app checks GitHub for a new release:

- **Release builds** (the primary auto-update target) fetch
  `/releases/latest` and compare the tag (`vX.Y.Z`) against the installed
  `versionName` using semantic version comparison. If the remote version is
  newer, the APK is downloaded.
- **Debug builds** (dev channel) list recent releases, filter to `dev-{sha}`
  tags, sort by `created_at` descending, and compare the newest tag's SHA
  against `BuildConfig.GIT_SHA`.

The downloaded APK is stored in the app's cache directory. An update status
icon appears in the slideshow top bar (visible when controls are toggled on):
spinner while **checking**, a circular progress ring with live percentage while
**downloading** (tap for a tooltip with ETA), red icon on **error**, and a
highlighted icon when **ready to install**. The icon is hidden entirely when no
update is available and nothing is in progress. Tapping the icon when ready
opens the install dialog (**Install** / **Later**), which can be re-triggered at
any time.

Downloads support HTTP Range-based resume: if a partial APK of the same version
already exists in cache, the download resumes from where it left off rather than
restarting. Old APKs from different versions are deleted before each new
download.

On the first install attempt, the app checks for the
**"Install unknown apps"** permission (`REQUEST_INSTALL_PACKAGES`). If not
granted, it opens the system settings page for the user to enable it before
launching the package installer.

The **Auto-Update** toggle and **Check Now** button are hidden when the app
is installed from the Play Store — Play Store installs receive updates through
the Play Store, not self-update.

### F6: Settings

Accessible from:
- Setup screen (before slideshow starts)
- In-slideshow controls (gear icon)

When a **six-digit Administration PIN** is configured, it is requested only
before sensitive actions: changing the album selection, server URL, API key,
or the PIN itself. Playback, display sleep schedule, Night Mode, and other
day-to-day frame settings remain adjustable without a PIN. The PIN itself is
not stored; an encrypted, salted verifier is kept locally. If the PIN is
forgotten, clearing this app's data is the recovery method and also clears its
configuration and cache.

Options:
- **Slideshow Interval** — seconds per image (5–120, default 30)
- **Image Fit** — Contain (letterbox) or Cover (crop to fill)
- **Adaptive Background** — fill letterbox bars with a gradient derived from
  each photo's edge colors (top/bottom for horizontal bars, left/right for
  vertical bars; uses Palette API, default off)
- **Shuffle** — randomize image order (default on)
- **Skip Videos** — permanently on and disabled in the UI
- **Muted** — retained from upstream but has no effect in image-only mode
- **Photo Animations** — subtle Ken Burns zoom/pan on each photo (default off).
  Also serves as burn-in protection for always-on displays. When enabled,
  reveals individual toggles for: Zoom In, Zoom Out, Pan Left,
  Pan Right, Pan Up, Pan Down, Random. Random picks from other enabled types
  and requires at least one other enabled.
- **Fullscreen** — hide status and navigation bars across all in-app screens
  (default on). A swipe can reveal them temporarily; they auto-hide again.
- **Keep Screen On** — wake lock toggle (default on)
- **Display Sleep Schedule** section (recommended, default off):
  - **Scheduled display sleep** — releases the app's Keep Screen On policy at
    the configured off time, allowing the device's configured screen timeout
    to turn the panel off. It uses a daily Android alarm to wake the panel at
    the configured on time without sound, vibration, or a notification.
  - **Turn display off at** / **Wake display at** — independent 24-hour time
    pickers (defaults: 22:00 / 07:00). Enabling this setting also enables the
    base Keep Screen On policy so the slideshow remains visible after wake-up.
  - The device's system screen-timeout must be set to a short value (15
  seconds recommended). This is not a hardware power-off feature. This app
    supports Android 8+. On Android 12+, Settings asks for Android's
    **Alarms & reminders** special access to run at the configured time;
    without it, the schedule remains available but can run late. Manufacturer
    battery restrictions can also delay it; Night Mode is the fallback.
- **Night Mode** section (brightness-only fallback):
  - **Night Mode** toggle (default off). Use this when Display Sleep Schedule
    cannot reliably turn the panel off. Photos keep displaying while the
    per-window brightness is reduced during configured night hours.
  - **Dim screen at** — 24h time picker (default 22:00). When the clock
    crosses this time, brightness drops to the night level.
  - **Brighten screen at** — 24h time picker (default 07:00). When the clock
    crosses this time, brightness restores to the system level.
  - **Night brightness** — slider 0–100% (default 0%). The app combines a
    per-window brightness cap with a black overlay: 0% is a black screen and
    100% preserves the device's configured brightness. Intermediate values
    smoothly dim the visible slideshow; playback continues normally.
- **Start on Boot** — launch on device boot (default off). Requires the "Display over other apps" permission (Android 10+ BAL exemption); on Chinese OEMs, also shows an "Open Autostart Settings" button until a reboot confirms the receiver fired.
- **Launcher Mode** — register as a Home launcher (default off; only visible when Start on Boot is enabled). The most reliable autostart method; the system always launches the Home app on boot, bypassing BOOT_COMPLETED and OEM autostart blocks entirely. Shows an "Open Launcher Settings" button to switch launchers or re-select this app; the same action is available in the slideshow hover UI.
- **Auto-Update** — permanently disabled until a fork-owned signed release
  channel is configured.
- **Media Cache** section:
  - **Auto Sync** — automatically download new photos and remove deleted
    ones in the background (default on)
  - **Sync Interval** — 60, 180, 360, 720, or 1440 minutes (default 360)
  - **Sync Now** — trigger an immediate one-time sync
- **Clock** section:
  - **Show Clock** — display time overlay (default off)
  - **Clock Size** — slider 24–96 sp (default 48)
  - **Clock Format** — 24h (default) or 12h with AM/PM
  - **Show Seconds** — display seconds in the clock; updates every second (default off)
  - **Snap to Grid** — align clock to grid on release (default on)
- **Connection** section:
  - **Server URL** — editable inline
  - **API Key** — editable inline. For security, tapping **Edit** empties
    the field (the key is never pre-populated); the user must re-type it.
    When the key is set, **Reveal** (shows the key in monospace; tap again to
    hide) and **Copy** actions require the Administration PIN when one is
    configured.
  - Test Connection button
  - **API Key Permissions** card (shown when a key is set):
    - Lists all 4 required permissions with ✓ (granted), ✗ (denied),
      or ? (unknown — couldn't probe) status icons.
    - **Re-check** button re-probes all endpoints.
    - Auto-refreshes every time Settings is opened.
    - If blocking permissions are missing, the card uses an error-colored
      background and shows guidance to regenerate the key.
- **Feature gating:** Skip Videos is locked ON by the fork profile regardless
  of permission status; `asset.download` is not requested.
- **Albums** — change album selection (returns to album picker). This requires
  the Administration PIN when one is configured.
- **Reset All Settings** — clears all settings, credentials, album selection,
  and cached data, returns to setup screen. Tour completion is **preserved**
  (use "Reset All Tours" to clear tour progress).

### F8: Media Selection

The media-selection grid remains an internal screen but is not exposed from
the slideshow controls in this dedicated photo-frame profile. Individual-photo
visibility is intentionally not a guest-facing operation.

1. User taps the grid icon in the slideshow controls.
2. Biometric prompt appears (fingerprint / face / device PIN). If the user
   cancels, nothing happens. If no screen lock is set up, a dialog directs
   them to security settings.
3. On success, a grid of all album assets loads (cache-first, thumbnails via
   Coil). Each thumbnail shows:
   - A checkmark badge (white = shown, dimmed = hidden)
   - A video badge for video assets
   - A dim overlay on hidden assets
4. Tapping a thumbnail toggles its shown/hidden state. Changes persist
   immediately to DataStore and take effect the next time the slideshow
   loads.
5. A **"Show new photos by default"** switch at the top controls the mode:
   - **ON** (default): all media starts shown; tapping hides individual items.
     New photos added to the album later appear automatically.
   - **OFF**: all media starts hidden; tapping shows individual items. New
     photos added later are hidden until manually shown.
   Flipping the switch preserves the current visible selection — it only
   changes the default for future new media.
6. **Show All** / **Hide All** buttons provide bulk selection.
7. A counter shows "X of Y shown" in the top bar.
8. Back arrow returns to the slideshow.

## Error Handling

| Scenario | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Server unreachable | If cache has content: keep showing cached media (offline mode). If cold start: show error + retry on album selection screen. |
| API key invalid (401) | Show "API key rejected", return to setup |
| Selected album deleted on server (404) | Purge that album's cache. If all selected albums gone: clear selection, navigate to album selection. |
| Server reachable but zero albums | Show "No albums available" message with retry button |
| Album has no images | Skip album, show toast notification |
| Image fails to load or does not complete loading within 20 seconds | Skip to next image, log error |
| Update download fails | Show "Update check failed" on Check Now button, allow retry |
| Network timeout | Retry up to 3 times with backoff, then skip |
| Transient empty metadata response | Preserve existing cache (do not prune); retry on next sync |

### F7: Onboarding Tour

The app includes a **modular, per-step onboarding tour** that teaches users
the available settings and controls. The tour is triggered automatically when
a user lands on a screen — only steps not yet completed are shown.

**How it works:**

- Each screen (Setup, Albums, Slideshow, Settings) declares an ordered list
  of tour steps. Each step has an ID, a tooltip title/body, and an optional
  target element (a control or section to spotlight).
- When the user navigates to a screen, the tour checks which of that screen's
  step IDs are NOT yet in the persisted `onboarding_completed_steps` set. If
  any remain, the tour auto-starts for those steps. The Settings screen waits
  for that persisted state to load before evaluating the tour, so a completed
  tour never flashes briefly while the screen opens.
- The overlay shows a semi-transparent scrim over the screen with a
  rounded-rect spotlight cutout around the target element (if any). A tooltip
  card displays the step title, body, step counter ("Step X of Y"), and
  **Next/Got it** + **Skip** buttons.
- Completing a step (Next/Got it) marks its ID as completed. Skipping marks
  all remaining steps on that screen as completed.
- **Slideshow-specific behavior**: during the tour, the on-tap controls are
  force-shown and the 5-second auto-hide is suppressed, so the tour can
  spotlight the prev/next, pause/mute, and settings buttons.
- **Settings-specific behavior**: the tour scrolls the target section into
  view before showing its spotlight (System → Media Cache → Connection).
- **Two replay buttons** in Settings → System section:
  - **"Show Tour Again"** clears only the Settings screen's step IDs, so
    only the Settings tour re-runs.
  - **"Reset All Tours"** clears the entire completed-steps set, so the
    tour re-runs on every screen next visit.
- A **"Show Tour Again"** button is also available on the Setup screen.
- Resetting all settings also clears the onboarding set (DataStore is wiped).

**Step inventory (20 steps across 4 screens):**

| Screen | Steps |
|---|---|
| Setup (6) | `setup_welcome` (centered), `setup_server`, `setup_validate` (centered), `setup_apikey`, `setup_generate_key`, `setup_connect` |
| Albums (3) | `albums_select`, `albums_start`, `albums_settings` |
| Slideshow (7) | `slideshow_tap` (centered), `slideshow_nav`, `slideshow_playback`, `slideshow_media_selection`, `slideshow_albums`, `slideshow_update`, `slideshow_settings` |
| Settings (4) | `settings_overview` (centered), `settings_system`, `settings_cache`, `settings_connection` |

- **`slideshow_media_selection`**: highlights the grid icon next to the photo
  count. The tooltip explains that this opens the biometric-gated media
  selection grid where the user can choose which photos and videos appear.

- **`slideshow_albums`**: highlights the back-to-album-selection button.
  This button is biometric-gated.
- **`slideshow_update`**: highlights the update status icon. Since this icon
  normally only appears when an update is available, the tour force-shows a
  dimmed placeholder icon so the coachmark always has a visible target on the
  first run. The tooltip explains that the icon's presence means an update is
  available.
